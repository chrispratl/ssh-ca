# SSH CA

I have been writing novels. If you are not interested in reading them, just follow the instructions in [sample setup](#sample-setup) and be happy.

## Why?

tl;dr below.

Type `ssh somebody@server` - On first connect, your SSH client will ask you "Do you trust this server?". It will show you a very long sequence of characters. Since you care about computer security, you compare the public SSH host key of the server against this sequence and type "yes" - afterwards and not before.

This is the first problem I want to solve: I do not want to blindly trust the server to be the right one. Using a certificate, I can bypass this problem.

Next, I have loads of (virtual) servers - currently, two physical machines with about five virtual servers each - makes 12 machines I want to handle using SSH. Obviously, each of them has a password of at least 32 characters, each one is different (thanks so much to my password manager!). I am typing `ssh some_server` quite some times every day. Typing a password (or actually, copy/pasting it - thanks so much to my password manager!) is a pain in the ass - I prefer using SSH key-based authentication. Until now, as a solution, I deployed the SSH public key of my local machine to each of my servers. Only one password remains to be typed - the one of my SSH key (yes, of course my SSH key is saved with a password!).

Now I had the idea of having a machine (VM number 13!) which I can access using RDP all the time. I would use that one for developing, having access to my home network and some more stuff. Actually, none of your business. <br>
Point is, the public key of that one should also be deployed on each server. Also, there is the computer I got from my company for work. The third public key to be deployed. Wait, my work machine is a Windows machine. And I use WSL. There's the next one. (Actually, never mind - I only deployed the WSL public key...)

Now I reset my private computer some time ago. And, silly me, forgot to store my private SSH key somewhere. Next, I found out that RSA encryption is quite old and ed_25519 should be used instead (no source on that one!). Did you keep up, which SSH keys should be deployed on which server? Did you keep up which SSH keys actually were deployed on which server? No? Me neither.

And that's my second problem: I do not really want to deploy all my public SSH keys to each server. I did not know ansible at the time (I do now), which would have made the problem easier. But at the time of writing, I remembered an article I overread some time earlier: [If you’re not using SSH certificates you’re doing SSH wrong](https://smallstep.com/blog/use-ssh-certificates/). Hm. I don't want to do it wrong, so let's give it a shot. And here we are.

**tl;dr**:

Long story short, I have two problems:

-   I do not want to deploy public SSH keys of multiple clients to all my servers.
-   I do not want to check authenticity of a server on first connect.

## Sample setup

For the setup of my certificate authority (CA), I will use the following machines:

-   `auth-server`: The server which will hold the CA private key and sign the certificates. Only one directory of the server will be required (`/root/ssh-ca`). The `auth-server` can be the same computer as your desktop or server, I am just going to use a different name to not confuse anybody. Me for example.
-   `desktop`: The client machine. Most probably the machine you are reading this README on.
-   `server`: The server you want to connect to. Hence, on `desktop` you want to run the command `ssh somebody@server`.

Now for initial setup, do the following:

1. The SSH certificate authority itself essentially is a public/private key pair. Create it: `root@auth-server:/root/ssh-ca# ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C ca@$(hostname -d) -f ca`. Put a password on this one. Also, store the password.
2. Create the desktop certificate:
    1. Create a directory `auth-server:/root/ssh-ca/desktop`. The last part (`desktop`) needs to be unique per client/server for my script to work! Also, for a server, it should be the domain name - so, `server.example.com`. I will use this directory name as the certificate name and maybe as a principal.
    2. Copy `user@desktop:~/.ssh/id_{rsa,ed25519,...}.pub` to `root@auth-server:/root/ssh-ca/desktop/id_{...}.pub`
    3. Create the file `auth-server:/root/ssh-ca/desktop/principals` and add only one line: `server_username` - the username you want to login as on the server
    4. Go to the base directory of this script and run `root@auth-server:/root/ssh-ca# ./cert.sh desktop`
    5. Find a new file `auth-server:/root/ssh-ca/desktop/current-cert.pub`. Be excited!
    6. Copy this `current-cert.pub` to `user@desktop:~/.ssh/id_{same_as_before}-cert`. Omit the `.pub` part of the filename!
    7. Continue reading the next step. This is important - otherwise, you have nothing.
3. Authorize signed certificates on the server
    1. Copy `auth-server:/root/ssh-ca/ca.pub` to `server:/etc/ssh/ca.pub`
    2. Edit `server:/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and add the following line: `TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub`. Hence, if the client authenticates with a certificate signed by the CA, accept it (depending on the principals)
    3. Restart sshd: `root@server# systemctl restart sshd` on Debian/Ubuntu. This may differ on your server - but `sshd` should be called `sshd` on the most common Linux distributions.
    4. Now, try to login using SSH: `user@desktop$ ssh server_username@server.domain.com`. Remember that `server_username` needs to match the username you wrote into the `principals` file on the CA.
    5. If you are feeling lucky, delete `server_username@server:~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and try to login again. Do not forget to keep a backup (and an open SSH session to the server in case something does not work)!
    6. Now, be excited!
4. Create the server certificate:
    1. Create the directory `auth-server:/root/ssh-ca/server.example.com`. Here, `server.example.com` needs to resolve to your `server`. If you do not have a domain name for your server, use the IP address.
    2. The principals file is only needed if you have multiple hostnames for the server. All hostnames need to be listed separated by comma.
    3. Copy `server:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub` to `auth-server:/root/ssh-ca/server.example.com/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub`
    4. Create the certificate: `root@auth-server:/root/ssh-ca# ./cert.sh server.example.com`
    6. Copy `auth-server:/root/ssh-ca/server.example.com/current-cert.pub` to `server:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub`
    7. Edit `server:/etc/ssh/sshd_config` once more and add the line `HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub`
    8. Again, restart sshd - see above
    9. Again, continue reading the next step - otherwise, nothing will change.
5. Adapt known_hosts: Let your client know that it can trust servers with a certificate signed by your CA
    1. Edit `desktop:~/.ssh/known_hosts` (Backup!)
    2. If you are feeling lucky (Backup!!), delete all the contents of the file. Remember that it's not my fault.
    3. Add a new line that reads as follows: `@cert-authority *.domain.com ssh-ed25519 *`.
        - The `ssh-ed25519 *` part should be the contents of the `ca.pub` file.
        - `*.domain.com` could also be IP addresses - for example, `192.168.0.*`.
    4. SSH to your server. Hope to not see an `Authenticate?` question. If you really want to test it, delete all the other lines in the `known_hosts` file. Hence, the only option for the server to authenticate is to present a signed certificate.

## Renewing certificates

If you want to renew a certificate, just run `./cert.sh {your_device}` and renew the certificate file on the device.

## What I want to add in this repo

-   Commands I found helpful
-   Description what the script does
-   Setup - Create SSH CA key, serial
-   Ansible!
-   Plans for the future
    -   Web Server
        -   Initial deployment for server and client - with preface on auth-server
        -   Renewal for client and server
        -   Update principals? Better not - due to security...
-   About expiration of certificates
-   Trouble shooting?
-   Server principals
